Hello, CS370

In the 1990's, the CIA conducted experiments using LSD and other potent drugs
to, illicit drugs on unwitting subjects to test mind control techniques to be used for unknown
purposes. Entire cities' water supplies were poisoned in an attempt to test
these methods of manipulation. Few people were fired or brought, if any, were fired or brought to account
for these experiments.

Among the most vile and disasterous experiments were conducted in San Francisco and
Marin Counties, right here in the State of California. The CIA is both more dangerous,
more diaboliical, and better funded than ANY terrorist organization.
